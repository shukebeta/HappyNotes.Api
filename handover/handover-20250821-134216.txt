# Context: Production deployment error - Microsoft.Extensions.Http assembly loading failure

## COMPLETED TASKS

### Production Deployment Fix
1. **GitHub Actions Deployment Configuration - RESOLVED**
   - Problem: Production deployment failing with "Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Extensions.Http, Version=9.0.0.0'"
   - Root Cause: GitHub Actions workflow was using system dotnet without version control, causing version mismatch between build and runtime environments
   - Solution: Modified deployment workflow to ensure consistent .NET 8.0 usage

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Key Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/deploy-to-production.yml`: Modified publish command to include explicit runtime and self-contained mode
- `global.json`: Created to lock .NET SDK version to 8.0.300

### Critical Changes Made
```yaml
# Original problematic publish command:
dotnet publish -c Release --property:PublishDir=/var/www/HappyNotes.Api

# Fixed publish command:
dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained false --runtime linux-x64 --property:PublishDir=/var/www/HappyNotes.Api
```

```json
// Added global.json for version locking
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "8.0.300"
  }
}
```

## ARCHITECTURE INSIGHTS
- Self-hosted GitHub Actions runner was using system dotnet without SDK setup
- .NET SDK setup step was intentionally commented out due to permission issues (/usr write access)
- Non-self-contained deployment relies on target system having compatible runtime version
- Version mismatch between Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly expectations and available assemblies

## CURRENT STATUS

### âœ… CONFIGURATION FIXED
- GitHub Actions workflow: Updated publish command with explicit runtime specification
- Version locking: global.json created to ensure consistent .NET 8.0.300 usage

### ðŸ”§ PENDING VERIFICATION
- Production deployment: Need to redeploy to verify assembly loading issue is resolved
- Runtime compatibility: Monitor for any remaining version conflicts after deployment

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

**CRITICAL**: Verify production deployment success after GitHub Actions changes

**Pending tasks**:
1. Trigger production deployment workflow to test the fix
2. Monitor application startup for assembly loading errors
3. Verify all Microsoft.Extensions.Http dependencies resolve correctly
4. Consider adding explicit Microsoft.Extensions.Http package reference if issues persist

**Session Status**: COMPLETE - Production deployment configuration fixed, pending verification through actual deployment
