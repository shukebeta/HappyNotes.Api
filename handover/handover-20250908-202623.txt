  # Handover - $(date +%Y-%m-%d %H:%M)

  ## CURRENT TASK plus a very brief background
  Code review fixes for Redis sync queue Phase 1 implementation. Colleague identified 6 critical production issues in queue infrastructure - all
  security/reliability risks that could cause startup failures or data loss.

  ## COMPLETED
  - [x] Fixed DI lifecycle error (ISyncQueueService singleton vs BackgroundService)
  - [x] Fixed atomic pop-to-processing (RPOPLPUSH + visibility timeout + recovery)
  - [x] Fixed statistics logic (totalProcessed counted failures/retries incorrectly)
  - [x] Added rate limiting to ProcessDelayedTasks (30sec interval per service)
  - [x] Fixed Redis connection resilience (Lazy + AbortOnConnectFail=false)
  - [x] Removed BotToken from Redis payload (security - now retrieved from encrypted DB)

  ## TODO
  - [ ] No immediate todos - all identified issues fixed

  ## FILES CHANGED
  - `src/HappyNotes.Services/SyncQueue/Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`: DI + Redis resilience
  - `src/HappyNotes.Services/SyncQueue/Services/RedisSyncQueueService.cs`: Atomic ops + stats + rate limiting
  - `src/HappyNotes.Services/SyncQueue/Services/SyncQueueProcessor.cs`: Recovery loop + correct stats calls
  - `src/HappyNotes.Services/SyncQueue/Configuration/SyncQueueOptions.cs`: VisibilityTimeout + RecoveryInterval
  - `src/HappyNotes.Services/SyncQueue/Models/TelegramSyncPayload.cs`: Removed BotToken
  - `src/HappyNotes.Services/SyncQueue/Handlers/TelegramSyncHandler.cs`: Runtime token decryption
  - `src/HappyNotes.Services/TelegramSyncNoteService.cs`: Removed BotToken from payload creation
  - `src/HappyNotes.Api/appsettings.json`: Added visibility/recovery timeouts

  ## NEXT ACTIONS
  1. Deploy to staging environment and verify queue behavior
  2. Monitor Redis queue stats and recovery metrics in production
  3. Continue with Phase 2: extend to Mastodon/Manticore handlers (per handover doc)

  ## BLOCKERS/NOTES
  - All 6 production-critical issues resolved
  - Tests: 115 pass, 0 fail - no regressions
  - Ready for staging deployment
  - Colleague's review was exceptional - caught 6 major risks
