# Context: Resolve Microsoft.Extensions.Http dependency conflicts in production deployment

## COMPLETED TASKS

### Dependency Resolution Analysis
1. **Root Cause Identification - COMPLETED**
   - Problem: Production deployment failing with "Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions, Version=8.0.0.0'"
   - Root Cause: Framework-dependent deployment expecting runtime libraries that don't exist on production server
   - Analysis: Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly 9.0.8 pulls .NET 9 dependencies but production has incomplete .NET 8 runtime

### Deployment Pipeline Fixes
2. **Execution Order Correction - COMPLETED**
   - Problem: SystemD service starting before DLL files were published
   - Solution: Reordered workflow steps - create service file early (needs source), build/publish, then start service
   - Files Modified: `.github/workflows/deploy-to-production-test.yml`

3. **Safe Deployment Process - COMPLETED**
   - Problem: Deleting files while service was running could cause crashes
   - Solution: Added proper stop -> clean -> deploy -> start sequence
   - Implementation: Added "Stop test service before cleaning directory" step

4. **Staging Environment Recovery - COMPLETED**
   - Problem: Staging was broken due to overlay installations mixing old/new dependencies
   - Solution: Added directory cleaning (`rm -rf` target directory) before deployment
   - Result: Staging now works with simple framework-dependent deployment

### Workflow Architecture
5. **Safe Production Testing Environment - COMPLETED**
   - Created `deploy-to-production-test.yml` workflow
   - Deploys to `/var/www/HappyNotes.Api.test` on port 5013
   - Independent systemd service `HappyNotes.Api.test.service`
   - Uses production secrets but isolated testing

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Key Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/deploy-to-staging.yml`: Added feature branch support, directory cleaning
- `.github/workflows/deploy-to-production.yml`: Simplified to match working staging approach
- `.github/workflows/deploy-to-production-test.yml`: Complete safe testing workflow
- `src/HappyNotes.Api/HappyNotes.Api.csproj`: Restored self-contained deployment configuration

### Critical Architecture Discovery
**Production vs Staging Environment Differences:**
- Staging (ARM64): Uses system dotnet, complete runtime environment
- Production (racknerd): Uses `/home/shukebeta/.dotnet/dotnet` with incomplete .NET 8.0.5 runtime
- Missing: `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions 8.0.0.0` in production runtime

### Deployment Patterns Identified
```bash
# Safe deployment sequence:
1. Create service files (needs source code access)
2. Build and publish application
3. Stop existing service
4. Clean deployment directory
5. Deploy new files
6. Replace configuration placeholders
7. Start service

# Critical: Directory cleaning prevents dependency mixing
rm -rf /var/www/HappyNotes.Api/* # Before publish
```

## ARCHITECTURE INSIGHTS
- Framework-dependent deployment requires exact runtime library matching between build and production
- Self-contained deployment solves cross-environment dependency issues but increases deployment size
- Staging success with simple approach doesn't guarantee production compatibility
- SystemD service file paths must match deployment reality (`/home/shukebeta/.dotnet/dotnet`)
- Core dumps provide detailed dependency resolution failure analysis

## CURRENT STATUS

### âœ… FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- **Staging Environment**: Working with framework-dependent deployment after directory cleaning
- **Safe Testing Framework**: Production-test workflow ready for validation
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Proper execution order and service lifecycle management

### ðŸ”§ PENDING VERIFICATION
- **Production-test Deployment**: Self-contained deployment needs testing (just pushed)
- **Dependency Resolution**: Need to verify self-contained fixes the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions issue

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

**CRITICAL**: Test production-test workflow with self-contained deployment

**Expected Outcome**: Application should start without FileNotFoundException

**Immediate Next Steps**:
1. Monitor production-test workflow execution with latest self-contained changes
2. Verify application starts successfully on port 5013
3. Test API endpoints for functional verification
4. If successful, apply same self-contained approach to main production workflow

**If self-contained deployment fails**:
1. Analyze new error messages
2. Consider RuntimeIdentifier correctness (linux-x64 vs linux-arm64)
3. Investigate build environment vs production environment SDK version alignment

**Long-term Tasks**:
1. Document final working solution for future deployments
2. Consider standardizing all environments on same deployment approach
3. Update systemd service files to use consistent dotnet paths

**Session Status**: IN-PROGRESS - Self-contained deployment fix pushed, awaiting production-test validation
